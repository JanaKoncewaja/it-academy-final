<p class="text-xl-left">The term 'smart home' is used to describe a house that contains a communication network that connects different appliances and allows them to be remotely controlled, monitored and accessed, according to the Department of Trade and Industry.

                        Smart devices connect to the internet and many have smartphone apps allowing you to access and control them remotely over wi-fi.

                        Itâ€™s becoming easier to connect an entire home too. Broadband is faster, more reliable and more affordable than ever before. The improved signal range of Wi-Fi routers means that a single router can offer wireless coverage across more rooms in our homes, allowing more devices to be connected.</p>
